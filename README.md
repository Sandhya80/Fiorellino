## 🐞 Bug Fixes

Several issues were identified and resolved in the **Fiorellino Blog Page** to enhance performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO:

1. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Added `loading="lazy"` to all images to enable lazy loading, reducing initial page load time.
   - Used `defer` for non-critical JavaScript files to prevent render-blocking.

2. **Accessibility Fixes**:
   - Added descriptive `alt` attributes to all images for better screen reader support.
   - Ensured proper ARIA roles for navigation elements.

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Replaced `<link>` tags in the footer with `<a>` tags for proper functionality.
   - Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links to prevent security vulnerabilities.

4. **SEO Enhancements**:
   - Added structured data (`JSON-LD`) for the blog page to improve search engine visibility.
   - Optimized meta tags with relevant keywords and descriptions.

These fixes ensure a faster, more user-friendly, and SEO-optimized experience for visitors across all devices.
